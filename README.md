# Image-Classification-Model-Development
# A machine learning model for image classification
# Dataset:
● The dataset is divided into three sets: train, validation, and test.
● Train set: Approximately 14,000 images.
● Validation set: Approximately 7,000 images.
● Test set: Approximately 3,000 images.
● Each image is labelled with the corresponding category (0 for buildings, 1 for forest, 2 for glacier, 3 for
mountain, 4 for sea, and 5 for street).
# Frameworks and Libraries:
● Use Python as the programming language for this task.
● Utilise any popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn for
# Model development.
● Make use of relevant packages like pandas and numpy for data preprocessing and manipulation.
Model Development:
● Choose an appropriate model architecture for image classification, such as a convolutional neural
network (CNN).
● Implement the chosen model architecture using your selected framework.
# Training and Evaluation:
● Train your model on the training set.
● Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation set.
● Report evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and any other relevant metrics to assess
the model's performance.
● Optimise the model and hyperparameters as needed to achieve the best possible performance.
